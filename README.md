Hey oh!!! Into fitness, crypto, rock climbing, and/or aviaition then hit me up.

My name is Alantheus.  I'm working on gym member engagement software to help big box gyms increase membership retention by using computer vision to direct staff/member engagements in near real time.  

The problem is that gym members want a friendly and encouraging environment, but often get a cold lonely experience with no interaction, leading to a loss of motivation and quitting.  

As the industry moves to a more individualized approach, staffing costs rise, and staff quality decrease it’ll become more costly to staff facilities in a way that can deliver the experience gym members want.

That’s why we are developing GroeFit to enable staff to be more effective at real-time member engagement and deliver that experience.

My background is in the Marines running flight and maintenance operations overseeign about 300 people.  Since separating though I've been validating and expanding my experience and education.  I'm certified in Project, Production, & Inventory Mgmt, obtained my MBA, and now currently expanding on my tech knowledge with a Data Science bootcamp.  

Other than that juggling staying active and fit, family, and the chaos that is life :)
